This is a simple vim plugin to automatically load config files for plugins loaded with Vundle.

I've found it useful to keep separate files for plugin configuration to make them easier to
manage.  This plugin will load configuration files located in a specified directory based on the bundle name.

The config files should be named pluginName.vim and should be located in the ~/.vim/config directory, 
where pluginName is the plugin name without any 'vim' prefix or suffix.  For example if you have the following 
config:
```
Bundle 'tpope/vim-fugitive.git'
```

The configuraiton should be in 
```
~/.vim/config/fugitive.vim
```

In your vimrc, place the vundle config init script right after the vundle init script
```
"Required by Vundle
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
call vundle#rc()
"Required by vundleconfig
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundleconfig/
call vundleconfig#init()
```

Be sure any configuration options that your plugin configuration relies on has already been done.  For example, 
make sure your leader is set to what you want.
